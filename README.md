# Conway's Game of life in 3D

This is a 3D Version of Conway's Game of life. Every new generation, a new layer is added on top. Green cells are new borns, blue cells are survivors.

You can load and save presets and of course, add new cells manually.

The presets are saved in a presets.cfg, which can be edited in a text editor (for removing unwanted presets).

Here is a sample video of the project: https://youtu.be/MrHAEKw8LmI
